Why TypeScript + React?

With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.

Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete

## Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.

TypeScript is just frustrating most of the times.

I have to write a lot more code than I normally do and the compiler keeps complaining. I simply don't know what to do about those errors.

It doesn't seem to be productive for me.
